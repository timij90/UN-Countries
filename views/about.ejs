            <p class="px-2">Hey there! My name is Jacobs Timi Uba and I'm currently studying Computer Programming &amp
              Analysis at
              Seneca Polytechnic.
            </p>
            <p class="px-2">This website was created for the WEB322 course which displays a vibrant and
              adaptable design.

              Inside, you'll find pages dedicated to different countries, a brief overview of who I am, and a custom 404
              error page.<br>

              To ensure a smooth user experience, I've made the site adaptable to various devices. The landing page
              features links to different country regions in a dropdown menu, and the "about" section explains the
              project
              and tells a bit about myself.<br>

              I've also added a touch of style using Tailwind CSS and daisyui for a polished and professional look.<br>

            <p class="px-2">Outside of school, I love to play tennis and listen to music.</p>
